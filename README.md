## Purpose

Multi-core replication to make Monte Carlo simulation faster more easily.
Based on the `mcreplicate` function from the rethinking package. 
The [rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking) package requires installing [rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstan), 
which can be a hurdle, while also not adding capabilities to this function.
